Diet
======

Diet tries to create a jar from all of the jars used by a project.
The result jar should contain only classes the project actually uses, nothing else.

This is currently just a library, but it should [evolve to a Maven plugin](https://github.com/Codarama/diet-maven-mojo), an eclpse plugin and perhaps a web project.

It's main target group is currently android development as space conservation is mostly uneeded for web development.

## Features

### Source Dependency Resolution:

Diet can resolve the dependencies of .java source files. 
Currently like this:

```java
final Set<ClassName> dependencies = Dependencies
    .ofSource(SourceFile.fromFilepath("/abs/path/to/Source.java"))
    .set();
```

### Binary Class Dependency Resolution:

Diet can also resolve the dependencies of compiled binary .class files:

```java
final Set<ClassName> dependencies = Dependencies
    .ofClass(ClassFile.fromFilepath("/abs/path/to/Class.class"))
    .set();
```

The `Dependencies` API can also work with the classpath or with Core API `File` objects (no streams yet though).
For more info on the `Dependencies` API have [a look at the wiki](https://github.com/ayld/Facade/wiki/Dependencies-API).

### Library minimization:

This will try to find all the 'actual dependencies' that a set of sources use, package them in a Jar and return it.

```java
final JarFile outJar = Minimizer
    .sources("/abs/path/to/src/dir")
    .libs("/abs/path/to/libs") // this can also be a Maven ~/.m2/repository
    .getJar();
```

You can also set the output dir for the minimizer, have [a look at the wiki](https://github.com/ayld/Facade/wiki/Library-Minimization) for info.

### Component Events:

Diet can notify you for updates on what it is currently doing. For instanse if you want to get detailed info while 
resolving the dependencies of a binary class you can:

```java
ListenerRegistrar.register(new EventListener<ComponentEvent>() {
    public void on(ComponentEvent event) {
        // will be called on any event
    }
});
```

There is a whole hierarchy of events you can listen to, there is [a wiki page](https://github.com/ayld/Facade/wiki/Component-Events-and-Listeners) on this also.

### Usage:

In order to use the library you can either:

 * [Download the latest binary .jar](https://github.com/codarama/Diet/releases/tag/v0.6-alpha.1),
in which case you will also need the dependencies. You can either find them [in the POM](https://github.com/Codarama/diet-engine/blob/master/pom.xml),
or download them from [the dependencies project](https://github.com/ayld/facade-dependencies).
 * Build [the latest tag](https://github.com/codarama/Diet/releases/tag/v0.6-alpha.1) with [Maven 3.x](http://maven.apache.org/). Just
clone it and run `mvn clean install` in your local copy. This way Maven will get the dependencies for you.
 * [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) can also be used to build the sources, [we have a separate branch for it](https://github.com/Codarama/diet-engine/tree/gradle-build) for now.

You can also build the master branch (on your own risk) in the same way you build the latest tag.

### Notes:

Keep in mind that we're currently in very early alpha and the API changes constantly and can change dramatically :)
Also wildcard imports in source files like `import com.something.*;` are currently not supported. So calling source
dependency resolution on such a file or on a set containing one will result in an exception.
